#The project aims to address the urgent need for accurate early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on Alzheimer's disease. Traditional diagnostic methods have proven inadequate for timely identification, hindering effective treatment and intervention. Leveraging machine learning and handwriting analysis, this project seeks to bridge this diagnostic gap. By utilizing a secondary dataset from the DARWIN repository, the project develops machine learning models to distinguish between healthy individuals and Alzheimer's patients. Results from the LGBM classifier have shown promising performances on the default configuration of the model. But, in our tuned model out performed for the hyperparameter have been tuned. The main reason of the decrease in accuracy is because of the use of the subset which has a smaller number of features.
